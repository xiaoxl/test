    fff study the case that $X$ is the total space of the canonical line bundle over a smooth projective surface $S$ which satisfies a specific condition. In this case, a modified Donaldson-Thomas theory of $X$ is computed by the Seiberg-Witten theory on $S$ and some invariants of ``nested Hilbert schemes'' on $S$. The formula is given explicitly.
